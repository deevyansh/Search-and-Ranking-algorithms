 (a) If there were no communal settlement in India, then the logical conclu sion of Mr. Gandhi to this would be that unless and until there were a settlement, there could be no further advance in the constitutional field. Even if Mr. Gandhi himself felt this, it was not possible for Government to accept it. Government had often been accused of Machiavellian methods, and if it adopted the line taken by Mr. Gandhi himself, there would be an immediate outcry accompanied by political agitation on an intense scale. This must, therefore, be ruled out, and Government must assume constitutional advance, even if no agreed communal settlement were reached. Why should Mr. Gandhi take in this matter a more reactionary attitude than Government were prepared to take? Moreover, even if a settlement were not reached in India, this did not necessarily mean that one would not be reached in England. Conditions were in some respects more favourable there than here : representations of various interests would be in constant touch with each other; atmosphere would be better; British leaders were prepared to give the greatest assistance possible and in fact an agreement had almost been reached in London on the last occasion. Moreover, Lord Irwin would be certainly ready to help. (Here at this point Mr. Gandhi made the suggestion that Lord Irwin might even act as an arbitratoran admission entirely contrary to some of his previous declarations that Indians should settle among themselves.) A settlement in London was more likely to be secured if Congress were represented and Mr. Gandhi himself might be expected to play a considerable part in it. In any case, he would not help by staying in India and, so far as the communal question was concerned, his clear duty was to go to England.
